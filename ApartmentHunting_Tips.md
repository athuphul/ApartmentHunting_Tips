##### The Checklist

### Unit

- [ ] Ensure you see the EXACT unit you'll be moving into and not a staged one
- [ ] If touring multiple units, take pictures/videos of each for later comparison
- [ ] Check the closets and storage space to ensure there's enough room for your stuff
- [ ] Check ceiling heights on different floors. Some complexes have high ceilings on the top or bottom floors
- [ ] Inspect the thickness of walls by tapping on them

### Neighborhood

- [ ] What's in close walking distance? (Food/bars/stores/etc.)
- [ ] `https://www.walkscore.com` rates addresses and neighborhoods based on access to public amenities like grocery stores/restaurants/etc. Useful if you don't own a car
- [ ] `http://judgmentalmaps.com/requested` shows who really lives in a neighborhood. Note - this might be slightly offensive and downright racist at times. I'm not endorsing the use of this, just putting it here as some people like to know what their neighborhood 'feels' like before going there
- [ ] `http://www.trulia.com/local/` lets you see average length of commute and has a Crime Heat Map.
- [ ] Check for train tracks nearby, those things are LOUD
- [ ] See if there is a quiet hours policy and how they handle repeat offenders
- [ ] Check the proximity to public transport hubs if you plan on utilizing them

### Utilities

- [ ] Cell phone reception
- [ ] Use a socket tester and test all outlets
- [ ] Ensure there are enough outlets in each room (some old apartments have very few)
- [ ] Check for 3 prong outlets
- [ ] Ensure there is an internet provider who gives you the speeds you want
- [ ] General price range of utilities such as heat/AC for the unit
- [ ] If the unit doesn't have an in-unit washer and dryer, check the prices and reviews of the nearest laundromats
- [ ] Call utility services such as `Avista` in your area (gas/electric) and ask what the average monthly bill is at an address
- [ ] Some places charge tenants for heat/gas/water/trash/recycling/AC etc.
- [ ] Certain apartment buildings split water usage by building and not by unit, ask explicitly
- [ ] See if they offer washer/dryer HOOKUPS or actual in-unit machines
- [ ] Exhaust fan in the kitchen may be important if you cook often

### Bed bugs, roaches, treatments
- [ ] Top of cabinets, behind stove/fridge for poop
- [ ] Red/brown stains in the corners where ceiling meets walls (bed bugs)
- [ ] Line of white powder along baseboards (roaches/bedbug treatment)
- [ ] White powder behind fridge/stove (roach treatment)
- [ ] Brown/tan kernel sized paste (roach treatment)
- [ ] Check the Bed Bug Registry online and ask for building's pest problem history
- [ ] Drawer under the oven and kitchen drawers

### Water

- [ ] Water pressure from all taps, especially the shower
- [ ] Water temperature and cold/hot extremes
- [ ] Time it takes for the water to get warm enough
- [ ] Fill and drain all sinks and tubs, check if the toilet flushes

### Maintenance

- [ ] Find out who does the maintenance (handyman/company/landlord)
- [ ] Work order policies and online submissions
- [ ] Response time guarantee for after hours emergencies

### Windows

- [ ] Double-paned/double glazed windows in good condition (Helps avoid high heating bills)
- [ ] Open and close easily
- [ ] Any strong light sources (street lamps/flood lights) close to your bedroom window(s)

### Neighbors

- [ ] Ask them what the worst part of the building/street/neighborhood is

### Vehicle and parking

- [ ] Designated parking spot and it's cost
- [ ] Visitor parking spots and permits, esp. on Fri/Sat night
- [ ] What happens if someone takes your spot?
- [ ] Drive through the area during rush hour if commuting by car

### Legal stuff

- [ ] Research the state's tenant laws
- [ ] Be clear on lease terms and know what utility bills you'll be paying
- [ ] Any promises/promotions offered to you, ensure you get in writing
- [ ] If there's an HOA, find out it's rules
- [ ] For lease breaks, what are the options/consequences?

### Safety and crime

- [ ] Check the crime index map and see reported crimes in the area
- [ ] Call a pizza place and see if they deliver there after dark
- [ ] Ask the police how often they have been called to the street/complex in the last 6 months
- [ ] Drive through the area around 10pm one day, 2am the next to get a 'feel' for the area, especially on Friday and Saturday nights
- [ ] Ask if they accept Section 8 or convicted felons if that's important to you
- [ ] Check the closest gas station late at night

### Misc.

- [ ] Experienced landlords are better to deal with than inexperienced ones
- [ ] Local managers/owners are better and know the area well
- [ ] Google your potential new landlord/agency. Online property records in the county and any foreclosure properties on their name
- [ ] Find out the policies on smoking/pets/noise and visitors
- [ ] Average rental time for apartments in the building is a good indicator of rent increases
- [ ] Shop around at many options in the area to see if what they're offering is a competitively priced option for the size/type of unit
- [ ] `http://www.padmapper.com/` is a great aggregator of all local online housing listings. They also have email alerts that you can set up.
- [ ] `Craigslist` is another resource widely used for housing. You can set up email alerts for Craigslist too when looking.
- [ ] Many people reported finding good deals quickly on Zillow and via Property Management Agents
- [ ] Other not-so-popular ways of apartment hunting are using University housing classifieds, Googling, calling apartment complexes and driving around looking for 'For Rent' signs
- [ ] Ask if the property is smoke-free or not

### AFTER you sign and get the keys

- [ ] Take a video walk through of the place, supplement it with pictures. Bonus points if you do this with someone from the leasing office
- [ ] Open/close every door/window/cabinet and document anything not in perfect condition
- [ ] Email yourself the video and cc the management company
- [ ] Do these exact same things when you move out, ideally the day you move out
